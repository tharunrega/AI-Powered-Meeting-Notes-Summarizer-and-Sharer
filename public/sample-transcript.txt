Meeting Transcript: Quarterly Product Planning (Q2 2023)
Date: April 15, 2023
Attendees: Sarah (Product Manager), John (Engineering Lead), Lisa (Design), Mike (Marketing), Emma (Customer Success)

Sarah: Good morning everyone! Thanks for joining our quarterly product planning meeting for Q2. We've got a lot to cover today, so let's dive right in. First, I wanted to give a quick recap of Q1 results and then discuss our priorities for the next quarter.

John: Before we get started, should we wait for Mike? I think he mentioned he might be a few minutes late.

Mike: Sorry, I'm here! Just joined. Had a last-minute call with the PR team about the upcoming campaign.

Sarah: Great, now we're all here. So, looking at Q1, we managed to release the messaging feature on time, which has seen a 42% adoption rate among our enterprise customers. The analytics dashboard update was delayed by two weeks but has been well-received with positive feedback from our beta users.

Lisa: Yes, and we've collected quite a bit of user feedback on the dashboard UI that we should incorporate in the next iteration.

Sarah: Absolutely. That's actually one of the items on our Q2 roadmap. Speaking of which, let's discuss our main priorities for the next quarter. I've shared a document with everyone that outlines the proposed features.

John: I've reviewed it and I think the timeline for the API integration might be a bit aggressive. My team is still wrapping up some technical debt items from Q1.

Sarah: That's a valid concern. What would be a more realistic timeline from your perspective?

John: I think we'd need at least an additional two weeks, especially considering we'll need to coordinate with external partners for testing.

Sarah: Okay, let's adjust that. Moving on to the mobile app redesign - Lisa, what's your team's bandwidth looking like for this?

Lisa: We should be able to handle it, but I want to make sure we allocate enough time for proper user testing. The last redesign was rushed and we ended up with some usability issues.

Sarah: Good point. Let's schedule a separate meeting to deep dive on the redesign timeline and testing strategy.

Emma: From the customer success side, I want to highlight that our enterprise clients have been asking for better export functionality. It's currently not on the roadmap, but it's becoming a common request.

Mike: That aligns with what we're hearing from prospects as well. It could be a good selling point for our Q3 marketing campaigns if we can get it done in Q2.

Sarah: Interesting. Let's evaluate if we can fit it into this quarter. John, would adding an enhanced export feature be a heavy lift?

John: It depends on the requirements. Basic CSV and PDF exports wouldn't be too difficult, but if we're talking about advanced integrations with other platforms, that's a different story.

Sarah: Let's start with the basic exports and we can phase in the integrations later. Emma, can you compile the specific requirements from our top clients?

Emma: Sure thing. I'll have that ready by Friday.

Sarah: Great! Let's also discuss our upcoming product launch. We're planning to release the team collaboration feature by the end of May. Mike, how are the marketing preparations coming along?

Mike: We're on track. The content team is working on the announcement blog post and demo videos. We've also scheduled a webinar for June 2nd. One thing I wanted to ask - will we have a beta period before the full launch?

John: We were planning a two-week beta with selected customers. We should be ready to start that by May 15th if all goes according to plan.

Mike: Perfect, that gives us enough time to collect testimonials for the launch.

Lisa: I'll make sure the design assets for the marketing campaign are delivered by the end of April.

Sarah: Excellent. One last major item for today - we need to decide on the pricing strategy for the new features. Our initial proposal is to include the team collaboration feature in all plans but make the advanced permissions part of the Enterprise tier only.

Emma: I think that makes sense. Most of our smaller customers won't need the advanced permissions, but they'll benefit from the basic collaboration tools.

Mike: Agreed. From a marketing perspective, it gives us a clear upsell path too.

Sarah: Any objections to this approach? [Pause] Alright, let's go with that plan. 

John: Quick question - will this require any changes to the account management backend?

Sarah: Yes, we'll need to update the permissions system. I've included that in the engineering tasks document.

John: Got it. Just making sure it's accounted for.

Sarah: Before we wrap up, let's go around and share any other concerns or ideas for Q2. Emma?

Emma: Nothing major to add. Just a reminder that we have the customer advisory board meeting next month, so we'll have more feedback coming in.

Mike: From marketing, we're planning to refresh our competitor analysis in April. I'll share that once it's ready as it might impact some feature priorities.

Lisa: Design team is good. We've been working on improving our design system, which should speed up UI development in the future.

John: Engineering is generally on board with the plan. We just need to be careful about not overcommitting, especially with the ongoing infrastructure migration work.

Sarah: Thanks everyone. To summarize: we'll adjust the timeline for API integration, evaluate adding export functionality to the roadmap, proceed with the team collaboration feature launch in May, and adopt the proposed pricing strategy. I'll update the Q2 roadmap document with today's decisions and share it by tomorrow. Any final thoughts?

[No responses]

Sarah: Great! Let's consider this meeting adjourned. Please review the updated roadmap when I share it and flag any concerns. Thanks for your time everyone!
